# Specific Proposed Changes to Curriculum

First thing to note is that the colored belts are grouped a little differently.
Typically, we think of the belts as being grouped like so:

1. white belts: "Beginners"
2. yellow, blue, and green belts: "Intermediates"
3. purple and brown belts: "Advanced"
4. black belts

The proposed grouping is now like this:

1. white belts: "Beginners", maybe "introductory students" could be a useful name here?
2. yellow and blue belts: (also) "Beginners"
3. green and purple belts: "Intermediates"
4. brown belts: "Advanced"
5. black belts

This regrouping helps to facilitate the idea of who is learning what:

1. Beginners are just learning what the basic movements and drills are. It is good to learn more, but just knowing what to do is enough.
2. Intermediates are expected to know the techniques and basic drills and to begin working on surface-level refinements.
3. Advanced students are expected to begin working on how the movements feel.

Additionally, this grouping allows for easier grouping of belt tests. Today, colored belt tests are all gouped together.
It might be beneficial to instead group students into tests based on the belt group they're testing into.

1. White, yellow, and first blue belt students test together
2. Second blue, greens, and first purple students test together
3. Second purple and first and second brown belt students test together
4. Third brown belt and black belt students test together

The primary reason is makes proctoring the exams easier and helps examiners to limit what to expect from students in regards
to technical level.

## Beginner Mudansha

### White Belt

* Removed the formal stances from the kihon section, but they're implied in the etiquette section of the social material
* Added Taikyoku Nidan since Taikyoku Sandan will be introduced next kyu
* Expanded the list of grabs and escapes to include upper arm grabs
* Formalized listing of social and scholastic requirements (continued through all ranks)

### Yellow Belt

* Remove knife-hand block
* Added stationary, standing back kick (was second blue material)
* Added strikes that require no conditioning
* Removed Heian Shodan and added Taikyoku Sandan. This eliminates the need to learn both knife-hand block at this level and allows for no kyu without a new kata to learn.
* Added grabs/escapes that are commonly used by unskilled attackers

### First Blue

* Begin adding fighting stance combinations as formal requirements. Combinations at this level are trivial.
* Removed close punch, morote uke, osaete uke (not needed yet)
* Added knife hand block (was yellow belt material)
* Added knife hand strikes (learning shuto as a block and as a strike at the same time seems reasonable)
* Added back kick stepping backwards (was first green material)
* Removed knife hand to spear and outside block to elbow combinations (moved to green belt)
* Changed Heian Nidan to Heian Shodan
* This belt is where any additional, less-common grabs and escapes can be picked up

### Second Blue

* Removed heisokudachi, kosa uke, tate shuto uke, and fumikomigeri (not needed yet). Fumikomigeri is never formally included since it isn't common in the kata and is typically done just like side thrust kick.
* Removed empi uchi (now taught to yellow belts)
* Removed ushirogeri moving backwards (now taught to first blue belts)
* Added morote uke (in kihon) (was first blue material)
* Removed double technique combinations (moved to first green belt)
* Added doing any single technique in reverse form

## Intermediate Mudansha

### First Green

* Removed kosadachi, juji uke, and kakiwake uke (not needed yet)
* Removed learning the remaining strikes (the unusual ones are learned later)
* Added close punch, kosa uke, tate shuto uke, and osaete uke (were first blue belt)
* Added vertical fist punch (seems reasonable to learn it with close punch)
* Removed stepping backwards ushirogeri (learned at first blue belt)
* Limiting double techniques to double punch, punch to block, and block to punch
* Adding to fighting combinations learned as first blue belt (jab, reverse, front kick; jab, lunge, reverse)
* Changed Heian Yondan to Heian Sandan
* Added kihon ippon kumite, including mawashigeri (was second green material)

### Second Green

* Removed kagezuki, haishu uke, and manji uke, mikazukigeri (not needed yet)
* Added kosadachi (only moving forward in kihon), nekoashidachi (only moving back in kihon), juji uke (any variant), and kakiwake uke. (kosa forward and nekoashi backwards pair well)
* Removed formally practicing uke gyaku uchi (purples will be practicing mixing any double combination)
* Removed age uke ura ashi maegeri (moved to purple belt)
* Added shuto uke shihon nukite and soto uke yoko empi (were first blue belt)
* Added changing kizamizuki to uraken in fighting stance combinations
* Changed Heian Godan to Heian Yondan
* Added kaiten ushirogeri to kihon ippon kumite

* Added age uke ura ashi maegeri (was second green belt)
* Added any combination of double techniques
* Added any kick to any arm technique and any arm technique to any kick
* Added lunging reverse to reverse fighting combination
* Added Heian Godan (was second green)
* Removed kihon ippon kumite mawashigeri (already learned at first green)

### Second Purple

* Removed namiashigeri (this is never really done in kihon and only exists in Tekki Shodan)
* Removed tobigeri (moved to ikkyu and after shuffle kick)
* Added kagegeri and uchimawashigeri
* Added alternating double kicks (free-form instead of fixed combinations) (was first purple)
* Removed perched four-kick combination (moved to brown belt)
* Removed jiyyu ippon kumite, multiple-attacker self-defense, and bunkai (moved to brown belt)

## Dansha

We don't currently have a formal dansha curriculum, so the proposed changed is to formalize the curriculum through sandan.
