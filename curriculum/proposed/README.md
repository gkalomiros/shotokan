# Shotokan Curriculum Overview

## Primary Goals

This curriculum aims to provide students with a clear, progressive path for learning what it means to be a Shotokan
martial artist. Traditional Shotokan, as a style, prioritizes physical and character development over competition
success or practical self-defense. Those topics are addressed, but not prioritized.

A student who earns their black belt should:

* Be comfortable with the common techniques and practices of Shotokan karate.
* Be able to use their body efficiently and effectively.
* Have familiarity with the karate world in general and Shotokan in particular.
* Be able to self-direct their own karate development.
* Be able to assist others in their Shotokan progress.

## Rank Groups

This curriculum groups ranks into four broad stages:

1. Beginner (Mudansha)
2. Intermediate (Mudansha)
3. Advanced (Mudansha)
4. Yudansha

Each stage has a learning theme that prepares the student for subsequent stages. That theme informs not just what
material is appropriate for each rank, but also what the student should be gaining from the material.

### Beginner Mudansha

**Rank:** untested, and 10, 9, and 8 kyu

**Belts:** White, Yellow, and Blue

**Approximate Time:** 1 year

**Themes:**

* **Physical:** Introduction to elementary single techniques, kata, and simple partner drills.
* **Social:** Introduction to dojo etiquette.
* **Mental:** Basics of dojo, organization, and Shotokan history. Understanding of curriculum overview.

Beginner students should spend most of their time learning how to behave in the dojo and familiarizing themselves with
elementary kihon techniques, the first few kata, and basic partner drills like gohon kumite and simple grab-defense.
Emphasis should be placed on developing familiarity, confidence, and enthusiasm over technical development. Familiarity
with Japanese vocabulary commonly used in the dojo, such as general commands, affirmations, and counting, should be
developed.

It is important for beginning students to have a basic understanding of this overall curriculum to help set expectations
and determine if this is the right kind of school for them.

### Intermediate Mudansha

**Rank:** 7, 6, 5, and 4 kyu

**Belts:** Green and Purple

**Approximate Time:** 1–2 years

**Themes:**

* **Physical:** Focus on proper alignment; introduction to basic combinations of elementary techniques; introduction to
  auxiliary single techniques; completion of foundational kata; introduction to basic kata applications; refinement of
  simple partner drills; introduction to intermediate partner drills.
* **Social:** Introduction to less common karate etiquette and basic leadership roles in the dojo.
* **Mental:** Begin learning Japanese terminology for techniques and learning more about Shotokan in general.

Intermediate students should begin focusing on proper alignment (posture and joint positioning) when stationary,
progressing towards maintaining alignment while in motion. Strength and speed should develop but not be emphasized at
this stage. Fixed combinations of basic techniques should be introduced, as well as less commonly used kihon techniques,
such as those that appear throughout kata (strikes) or are newer additions to the Shotokan curriculum (modern kicks).

The remaining Heian kata and the first Tekki kata should be learned, as well as select basic applications from them.
Partner drills learned as beginning students should become more refined, and students should concentrate on learning the
lessons of the drills rather than the drills themselves. Slightly more advanced versions of the partner drills should be
introduced.

Etiquette for less common karate situations, such as seminars, gasshuku, and tournaments, should be familiar by this
time. Basic leadership roles should be provided and encouraged: modeling and encouraging good behavior in junior
students, caring for the dojo, and participating in club membership.

Intermediate students should also begin to familiarize themselves with the Japanese vocabulary for Shotokan techniques.
They should be expected to learn about the Shotokan world in general, such as Shotokan lineages, closely related styles,
and tournament variations (JKA vs. WKF).

### Advanced Mudansha

**Rank:** 3, 2, and 1 kyu

**Belts:** Brown

**Approximate Time:** 2–3 years

**Themes:**

* **Physical:** Focus on proper kinesthetics in motion; combinations of both elementary and auxiliary techniques;
  learning Shotokan core kata and basic applications; refinement of partner drills; introduction to advanced partner
  drills.
* **Social:** Intermediate leadership roles in the dojo.
* **Mental:** Japanese terminology for concepts and learning more about karate in general.

Advanced students should focus on how they move. Particular attention should be paid to proper breathing, power
generation, balance, coordination, and footwork. Understanding how these concepts relate to performing combinations of
techniques should be developed, as well as exploring combinations that challenge these concepts. Shotokan's four core
kata should be learned, and each student should identify one that best suits them for deeper study. Advanced techniques
and strategies in semi-free kumite (tournament, dojo sparring, and self-defense) should be explored.

More leadership opportunities and responsibilities within the dojo should be encouraged: knowing how to start and end
classes, leading class warmups, teaching new techniques or kata to juniors, and club officer roles are all good
examples.

Advanced students should expand their Japanese vocabulary into more conceptual terms related to karate. Familiarity with
the karate world in general should be developed, including awareness of other major styles, lineages, and philosophies.

### Yudansha

**Ranks:** All dan ranks

**Belts:** Black

**Approximate Time:** Indefinite

**Themes:**

* **Physical:** Application of proper kinesthetics in all kihon, kata, and kumite; free-form combinations and
  combinations exploring more advanced footwork; learning auxiliary Shotokan kata curriculum; deep exploration of
  tokuigata; kata application synthesis; refinement of advanced partner drills and strategies.
* **Social:** Leadership within the dojo and at special events, such as promotions, gasshuku, and tournaments.
* **Mental:** Individualized research into Shotokan, karate-adjacent topics, or relating cross-training concepts into
  Shotokan training.

New black belts should begin working towards ensuring the lessons learned in their kihon are being applied evenly to
their kata and kumite training, the latter being more critical as they advance. They should learn and apply more
advanced footwork and placement in partner drills. Learning the expanded Shotokan kata should be prioritized, starting
with the auxiliary version(s) of their preferred core kata, then branching out to the auxiliary versions of the other
four core kata, and then the remaining kata. Deep study in their favored kata should be undertaken, including variations
(both within and outside of Shotokan), history (as available), and probable applications. The ability to synthesize and
evaluate applications from kata needs to be developed and, ideally, pressure-tested.

Black belts prepare for leadership roles pertaining to the dojo, such as teaching intermediate and advanced student
material, proctoring and judging promotions, leading sessions at gasshuku, judging at tournaments, developing
relationships with other dojo, and so on.

Black belts should direct their own research based on their particular interests, with the intent of enriching their own
karate and bringing their gained knowledge back into the dojo.
