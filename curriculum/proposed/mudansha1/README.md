# Beginner Mudansha Curriculum

## Overall

This is the material beginning students should learn and be able to demonstrate in preparation for the intermediate
curriculum. The main goal at this stage is in devleoping familiarity with the foundational practices and materials.
Technical ability, speed, and power, while taught, are not required for promotion at this stage. Comfort with the
material is most important so that students can begin the process of focusing on how and why things techniques are
done without being distracted by what techniques are being done.

Students should be able to complete this curriculum in about a year of consistent practice. Students with prior,
related experience may be able to meet the requirements in shorter time. For such students, care must be taken to
ensure that an honest effort is being made to adapt to this school's approach, and not over-relying on previous
experience.

## Physical

To be eligible for promotion to intermediate mudansha, students must be ready and able to perform any of the following
physical requirements on demand. Confidence and familiarity with the requirements, responsiveness to instructions
(hai/ossu), and strong spirit (kiai) are critical. Speed, power, and coordination are not major considerations at this
level and should not prevent students from promotion.

### Kihon

#### Stances/Footwork

Students must be familiar with the foundational Shotokan stances (front, side, back) and the standard Shotokan fighting
posture and guard. With basic stances, they should be comfortable with moving forward and backwards and with the
various turns, as demonstrated in kata. With fighting stance, they should be comfortable with moving forward with both
the lead leg short step and the rear leg stepping through.

#### Punches, Blocks, Kicks, and Strikes

Students must be able to comfortably demonstrate the foundational Shotokan punches (straight, lunge, reverse, jab),
blocks (rising, downward, inside, outside, knife-hand), kicks (front, side snap, side thrust, round, and back), and
basic strikes (palm heel, spear hand, knife hand, hammer fist, and elbows) in a kihon format. They should also be able
to perform other techniques as demonstrated in requisite kata.

Students should also be able to demonstrate the punches and kicks, moving forward, in a dictated fighting stance
format.

#### Combination Movements

Students should be able to perform simple, pre-arranged, two-movement combinations using punches and kicks, moving
forward in both a kihon and fighting stance format.

### Kata

Students must be able to demonstrate, on demand, the entry-level Shotokan kata: Taikyoku Shodan, Nidan, and Sandan;
and Heian Shodan and Nidan. The Taikyoku kata are required because they were designed specifically to be the
introductory forms for new Shotokan students. Both and only Heian Shodan and Nidan are selected because Itosu had
intended the Heian kata to be the introductory forms for karate students. Which comes first varies by karate style.
The remaining three Heian kata are not required until the second mudansha curriculum because requiring all five, a
total of eight forms, would be too much for students to learn within a year.

### Kumite

Kumite at this level is very formalized and predictable for the benefit of students with no prior experience in
fighting arts or sports. Focus should be on intention, attention, targeting, and distancing in the attacking role.
Focus for the defending role should be on attention, maintaining proper distance and posture, and developing poise
when being attacked. Speed and power are not expected at this level.

Students should be comfortable with the basic Shotokan five-step sparring drill, and should be able to perform it
like a two-person kata. While level-appropriate flaws in technique are expected, there should be no variations in
how the drill itself is performed, such as incorrect footwork, incorrect targeting, incorrect attack responses, or
incorrect counter-attacks.

Students should also be familiar with applying and escaping from simple grabbing techniques, like wrist, arm, and
shoulder grabs, and bear-hug. They should be able to demonstrate skill in a semi-free format. Grabs should be applied,
but then held static. Escapes should be done with appropriate counter-attacks before and after, and demonstrate
making distance after the escape before continuing.

## Social

Students must be familiar with and demonstrate proper day to day etiquette in a Shotokan dojo, such as lining up, when
and how to bow, and what to do when arriving late. They must be responsive to instructions and demonstrate spririt and
enthusiasm. Students should, unless specifically excepted, have consistent and timely attendence and have been training
for at least a year.

## Mental

Students must be able to identify their dojo, style, and instructors. Students should have basic knowledge of Shotokan
and the dojo curriculum. Ideally, students keep a training journal which can be reviewed by the chief instructor. At
this level, the practice of keeping a journal is more important than the content.
