## Social

Brown belts should begin taking on more leadership roles and responsibilities like be ready to start and end classes,
leading class warmups, and teaching material to beginner and intermediate mudansha.

## Scholastic

Students should still be keeping a training journal and doing outside research. Research should be expanded to
include the works of other notable Shotokan instructors and instructors of other karate styles. Research into other
relevant and specific topics, like kata application, grappling, throwing, kinesthetics, Okinawan history, Sino-Japanese
philosophy, and so on, are also encouraged. In the very least, students should learn about and understand concepts like
shoshin, mushin, zanshin, fudoshin, maai, sun do me, sen no sen, go no sen, and sen sen no sen.
