# Advanced Mudansha Curriculum

## Overall

This is the material advanced mudansha learn and must be able to demonstrate preparedness for the advanced mudansha
curriculum. Having demonstrated correct posture and joint alignment in their movements, students should focus on
improving how they move through their motions rather than simply arriving in the correct positions.

Students should be able to absorb the material in about two years of consistent practice, but taking longer is not
uncommon. Also, students at this level are evaluated on speed and power, which must come from correct application of
kinesthetic priniciples that coincide with Shotokan principles. For example, speed and power in a punch should be
based upon correct use of the lower body and posterior chain rather than depending soley upon the chest and shoulders.
While proper mechanics are expected to be developed in pre-determined exercises, it is not yet expected for them to be
fully integrated into free-form movements, like dynamic kihon or free-sparring.

## Physical

To be eligible for promotion to advanced mudansha, students must be ready and able to perform any of the following
physical requirements on demand. Confidence and familiarity with the requirements; proper posture; proper hip,
shoulder, knee, and elbow alignment; clear intention in movements; correct application of speed and power;
responsiveness to instructions (hai/ossu); and strong spirit (kiai) are all evaluated. All material from previous tests
can also be demanded upon testing and are expected to be performed at a level of competency equal to this level's
requirements.

### Kihon

#### Stances/Footwork

Students must become familiar with all stances present in any kata learned up to and within this curriculum. They
should become familiar with moving and turning in any direction, including spinning and jumping with techniques
to and from those stances. They should also become comfortable switching from stance to stance. All of this should
be performed using proper posture, alignment, and application of the body.

#### Punches, Blocks, Kicks, and Strikes

Students will not be learning new techniques at this level, per se. However, they will be learning to perform already
familiar techniques in new ways that help them to explore and improve upon how they use their bodies, such as using
alternative footwork, shuffling, jumping, and spinning.

#### Combination Movements

Combinations learned at this level are selected to help the student learn and explore kinesthetic principles and
footwork variations. Additionally, students should practice the ability to perform free-form triple combinations that
demonstrate variety in techniques, stances, and footwork.

### Kata

Students begin learning the core or foundational kata of the Shotokan style: Bassai dai, Empi, Jion, and Kanku dai.
They will be shown some typical applications from key sequences from the forms and encouraged to explore others and
derive their own. By the time they are ready to seek promotion to yudansha, one of the four kata should be selected as
their tokui (specialty) kata. Students are expected to do extra practice with and research into their specialty form.
They should have reasonable, effective applications for the movements within the form. When performed, it should be
clear the student is visualizing their applications, which may result in minor variations, or inflections, from the
standard method.

### Kumite

Students at this level are expected to apply lessons learned in kihon and kata, especially their specialty kata, during
kumite drills. That is, proper posture, alignment, kinesthetics, footwork, distancing, positioning, targeting, and
intention are all considered for when in both an attacking and recieving role. Students are also expected to begin
applying lessons learned to increasingly free-form and contested scenarios.

## Social

Students must be familiar with and demonstrate proper day to day etiquette in the dojo, be responsive to instructions,
and demonstrate spririt and enthusiasm. They should know how to, and ideally have demonstrated, perform basic
leadership duties in the dojo, like starting and ending a class, leading class warmups, and instructing beginner and
intermediate mudansha material at a level appropriate for the level being taught.

Students should be encouraged to participate or, at least, attend local karate events, even across styles.

Students should, unless specifically excepted, have consistent and timely attendence and have been training for at
least two years since being promoted to intermediate mudansha before seeking promotion to yudansha.

## Scholastic

Students are expected to already have a solid grasp of Japanese vocabulary for techniques. That vocabulary will be
expanded to include common conceptual terminology as well. Research should be expanded to include the works of other
notable Shotokan instructors and instructors of other karate styles. Research into other relevant and specific topics,
like kata application, grappling, throwing, kinesthetics, Okinawan history, Sino-Japanese philosophy, and so on, are
also encouraged.

In order to be promoted to yudansha, students are required to take and pass a written exam prior to being allowed to
take the physical exam. The written exam will give the student opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of:

* Japanese vocabulary for common terminology used in the dojo or at tournament
* Japanses vocabulary for and basic understanding of karate-related concepts
* Knowledge of general karate trivia such as styles, lineages, organizations, titles, etiquette, and symbology

Students should also expect a verbal question and answer session where examiners can ask for specific demonstration of
any required material.
