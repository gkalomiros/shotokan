## Social Material

Purple belt students should begin taking basic leadership roles in the dojo, such as leading class warm-ups and
introducing new techniques and kata to yellow and blue belts. When teaching, it is important to keep in mind that
junior students have a different focus than intermediate students.

## Scholastic Material

Students should continue maintaining a journal. Books read, seminars attended, and tournaments competed in are all
excellent sources for note taking. Once the introductory Shotokan books have been read, it is recommended that
students also read the texts by Nakayama and Nishiyama (the two JKA founders that wrote books).

Beginning at 1st purple, all students are required to take and pass a written examination before being allowed to
take the physical examination. For purple belts, the exam focuses primarily on Japanese vocabulary.

Additionally, beginning with the test for 2nd purple, all examinations will be conducted using only Japanese
terminology.
