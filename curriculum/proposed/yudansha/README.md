# Yudansha Curriculum

## Overall

**Themes:**

* **Physical:** Application of proper kinesthetics in all kihon, kata, and kumite; free-form combinations and
  combinations exploring more advanced footwork; learning auxiliary Shotokan kata curriculum; deep exploration of
  tokuigata; kata application synthesis; refinement of advanced partner drills and strategies.
* **Social:** Leadership within the dojo and at special events, such as promotions, gasshuku, and tournaments.
* **Scholastic:** Individualized research into Shotokan, karate-adjacent topics, or relating cross-training concepts into
  Shotokan training.

New black belts should begin working towards ensuring the lessons learned in their kihon are being applied evenly to
their kata and kumite training, the latter being more critical as they advance. They should learn and apply more
advanced footwork and placement in partner drills. Learning the expanded Shotokan kata should be prioritized, starting
with the auxiliary version(s) of their preferred core kata, then branching out to the auxiliary versions of the other
four core kata, and then the remaining kata. Deep study in their favored kata should be undertaken, including variations
(both within and outside of Shotokan), history (as available), and probable applications. The ability to synthesize and
evaluate applications from kata needs to be developed and, ideally, pressure-tested.

Black belts prepare for leadership roles pertaining to the dojo, such as teaching intermediate and advanced student
material, proctoring and judging promotions, leading sessions at gasshuku, judging at tournaments, developing
relationships with other dojo, and so on.

Black belts should direct their own research based on their particular interests, with the intent of enriching their own
karate and bringing their gained knowledge back into the dojo.
