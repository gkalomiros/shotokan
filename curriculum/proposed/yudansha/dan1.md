## Social

Shodan students should begin teaching both white belts and brown belts. They should learn how to judge at tournaments,
and begin presiding over exams where students are testing for a mudansha rank.

## Scholastic

Yudansha should be doing self-directed research into any topic. Broad topics to consider include, general kinesthetics,
general self-defense principles, teaching theory, Sino-Japanese and Okinawan history and philosophy, the Japanese
language, and cross-training in other martial arts. As students progress, they should not just be conducting study to
improve themselves, but also thinking of how to elevate others.
