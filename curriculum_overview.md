# Shotokan Curriculum Overview

## Primary Goals

This curriculum aims to provide students with a clear, progressive path for learning what it is to be a Shotokan
martial artist. Traditional Shotokan, as a style, prioritizes physical and character development over competition
success or practical self-defense. Those topics are addressed, just not prioritized.

A student who earns their black belt should:

* be comfortable with the common techniques and practices of Shotokan karate,
* be able to use their bodies efficiently and effectively,
* have familiarity with the karate world in general and Shotokan in particular,
* be able to self-direct their own karate development, and
* be able to assist others in their own Shotokan progress.

## Rank Groups

This curriculum groups ranks into four broad stages:

1. Beginner (Mudansha)
2. Intermediate (Mudansha)
3. Advanced (Mudansha)
4. Yudansha

Each stage has a learning theme which prepares the student for subsequent stages.
That theme, then, informs not just what material is appropriate for what rank,
but what the student, at minimum, should be getting from the material.

</div>

Beginner students should be spending most of their time learning how to behave in the dojo, and
familiarizing themselves with elementary kihon techniques, the first few kata, and basic partner
drills like gohon kumite and simple grab-defense. Emphasis should be placed on developing familiarity,
confidence, and enthusiasm over technical development. Familiarity with Japanese vocabulary commonly
used in the dojo, like general commands, affirmations, and counting, needs to be developed.

It is important for beginning students to have a basic understanding of this overall curriculum to
help set expectations, and to determine if this is the right kind of school for them.

Intermediate students should begin focusing on proper alignment (posture and joint positioning) when stationary, at first, and progressing towards maintaining alignment while in motion. Strength and speed should develop but not be emphasized at this stage. Fixed combinations of basic techniques should be introduced
as well as less commonly used kihon techniques, like those that appear throughout kata (strikes) or are newer additions the Shotokan curriculum (modern kicks).
The remaining Heian kata and the first Tekki kata should be learned, as well as select, basic applications from them. Partner drills learned as beginning students
should begin looking refined, and students should be concentrating on learning the lessons of the drills rather than the drill themselves. Slightly more advanced
versions of the partner drills should be introduced.

Etiquette for less common karate situations, like seminars, gasshuku, and tournament, should be familiarized by this time. Also, basic leadership roles should be
provided and encouraged: modeling and encouraging good behavior in junior students, care for the dojo, and participating in club membership.

Intermediate students should also begin to familiarize themselves with the Japanese vocabulary for Shotokan techniques. They should also be expected to learn
about the Shotokan world in general, like Shotokan lineages, closely related styles, tournament variations (JKA vs WKF), and so on.

                        <li>combincations of both elementary and auxiliary techniques,</li>
                        <li>learning Shotokan core kata and basic applications</li>
                        <li>refinement of partner drills,</li>
                        <li>introduction to advanced partner drills</li>
                    </ul>

                <li><b>Mental: Japanese terminology for concepts and learning more about karate in general</b></li>
            </ul></dd>
    </dl>
</div>

Advanced students should be focusing on how they move. Particular focus should be placed on proper breathing, power generation, balance, coordination, and footwork.
Understanding of how to these concepts relate to performing combinations of techniques should be developed and well as exploring combinations that challenge these
concepts. Shotokan's four core kata should be learned, and each student should identify one that best suits them for deeper study. Advanced techniques and strategies
in semi-free kumite (tournament, dojo sparring, and self-defense) should be explored.

More leadership opportunities and responsibilities within the dojo should be encouraged: knowing how to start and end classes, leading class warmups,
teaching new techniques or kata to juniors, and club officer roles are all good examples.

Advanced students should be expanding their Japanese vocabulary into more conceptual terms related to karate. Familarity with the karate world in general should be
developed. Examples include awareness of other major styles, lineages, and philosophies.

New black belts should begin working towards ensuring the lessons learned in their kihon are being applied evenly to their kata and kumite training,
the latter being more critical as they advance. They should be learning and applying more advanced footwork and placement in partner drills.
Learning the expanded Shotokan kata should be done, prioritizing the auxiliary version(s) of their preferred core kata, then branching out to the auxialiary
versions of the other four core kata, and then the remaining kata. Deep study in their favored kata should be undertaken, including variations, both within
and outside of Shotokan; history, as is available; and probable applications. The ability to synthesize and evaluate applications from kata needs to be developed,
and, ideally, pressure-tested.

Black belts prepare for leadership roles pertaining to the dojo like, teaching intermediate and advanced student material, proctoring and judging promotions,
leading sessions at gasshuku, judging at tournaments, developing relationships with other dojo, and so on.

Black belts should be directing their own research based on their particular interests, with the intent of enriching their own karate, but also bringing their
gained knowledge back into the dojo.
