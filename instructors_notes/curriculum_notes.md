# Curriculum Notes

## What Is the End Goal for a Student?

Over time, learning from instruction yields diminishing returns. Given that karate is for everyone and should be a
life-long pursuit, it follows that the main objective is to provide students with the skills needed to eventually
self-direct their Shotokan karate training. Given that, a student can be said to have reached the end of the formal
curriculum when they've learned all the traditions that define Shotokan and have demonstrated the skills needed to
direct their own further training.

## What Traditions Define Shotokan?

Universally, all instructors in the Shotokan lineage have agreed that the kata are central to karate training. If the
kata are not incorporated into practice, then that practice cannot be said to be karate. Modern Shotokan has a fairly
standardized syllabus of kata, and fairly standardized ways of performing each of those kata. There is no consensus,
and likely never will be, on what purpose the kata or the movements within them were meant to serve. It is commonly
held that most kata were meant to teach self-defense techniques and principles, but exactly what the principles were
or how the techniques are to be applied is lost.

Kihon training has always been a part of Shotokan training. It is thought that Itosu, or perhaps Yabu Kentsu, brought
the practice into karate, and it was not part of the original training that Funakoshi received. It is well established
that kihon training is not meant for combative application, but for physical education. Physical education should not
be confused with physical _conditioning_. Physical conditioning exercises were referred to as "hojo undo", included
practices like makiwara training and lifting heavy things, and predate kihon practice. Kihon is not for devleoping the
body, but learning how to use it effectively regardless of what condition it is in.

As stated, hojo undo training predates kihon and was definitely a part of early Shotokan practice. However, today,
there is no standard for physical conditioning across Shotokan, except, perhaps, the makiwara, or striking feedback in
general. Today, access to makiwara is very niche, but access to striking bags is common. Additionally, modern sports
science identifies a number of exercises that are good for whole body, functional strength, endurance, and flexibility.

Kumite has a varied history in Shotokan. Funakoshi was known to forbid kumite in his dojo, but exactly what form of
kumite he was opposed to is unclear. In Karate-do Kyohan, there is a whole chapter dedicated to the various forms of
kumite training that he endorsed. To my reading, what Funakoshi was against was kumite for the sake of ego rather than
as a method for improving one's applicative skills. My hunch is that is the core reason he was against competitions. It
is far too easy for practice to devolve into training to win at tournament rather that tournament being just another
form of training. In the interviews I've read, Obata, Nakayama, and Nishiyama all seemed to have regretted the impact
that them introducing competition, against Funakoshi's explicit wishes, had on Shotokan.

Much of the non-physical aspects of Shotokan, such as vocabulary, symbology, reigi, and ranks, seem to be fairly
uniform across organizations.

### Conclusions on Traditions

Someone who claims to be an expert in Shotokan should, at minimum:

* Know all 26 of the typically practiced Shotokan kata
* Be familiar with all the kihon exercises commonly practiced
* Be experienced with applying resisted striking techniques, like with a bag or makiwara
* Be familiar with all the kumite exercises commonly practiced
* Be comfortable with the vocabulary, manners, and practices common in Shotokan dojo

There are caveats:

* There is room for minor variation in how the kata are performed and total freedom in how meaning in the kata is defined.
* There is room for variation in how the kihon exercises are executed
* There is room for variation on the mix of how much time is spent across kihon, kata, and kumite practice
