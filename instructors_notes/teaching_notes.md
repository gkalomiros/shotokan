# Teaching Notes

1. Do not teach to the test. Students should not be focused purely on what is required for the next test. They should
   be focused on developing their karate, and the test is one way they demonstrate their progression. Of course, the
   material expected for the next exam must be taught, but memorization should be only a minor part of regular
   training.
2. Do not put undue focus on training for competitions. Students should be actively discouraged from thinking of
   winning at competitions as an end-goal. Everyone ages out of competition, so if their focus is only on competition,
   they're left lacking by the time they can no longer compete. Likewise, too much emphasis on winning in general is an
   exercise in pure ego, which is antithetical to earnest karate practice.
3. Do not totally rule out competitions. Competitions do have some value: They foster community and give students an
   opportunity to pressure test themselves under relatively safe conditions that isn't normally available to them.
4. Encourage students to branch out and self-study as much as possible. Cross-training, seminars, tournaments, watching
   others train and test, reading, and so on are all great ways to prevent stagnation and rigid thinking.
