# First Principles

In organizing this curriculum, the following principles should always be kept in mind:

1. [Karate Is For Everyone](#karate-is-for-everyone)
2. [Karate Practice Must Be Beneficial](#karate-practice-must-be-beneficial)

## Karate Is For Everyone

Karate should be available to anyone. There should be enough flexibility in the curriculum to allow for extreme cases,
like severe disability. While not everyone is capable of reaching black belt, disability should not be a limiting
factor. While it is recognized that improved physical condition is a net positive outcome, the curriculum itself should
emphasize using the body effectively regardless of its condition over developing or depending upon physical
conditioning.

### Corollary: Karate practice should not result in degredation of the body or character

No technique should be trained in a way that results in undue strain or degredation. In particular, care must be taken
to avoid chronic problems like joint damage or concussions. This leads to karate ultimately gating itself.

### Corollary: Karate Instruction Should Produce Students Capable of Self-Study

Because everybody's bodies, backgrounds, perceptions, and goals are different; people move away; instructors retire;
and so on, it is important that students learn how to guide their own training and adapt it to their own needs.
Students need to learn not just a series of techniques, but why those techniques are being taught and what can be
learned from them so that they can eventually learn and grow in their own direction without direct instruction.
Ultimately, as students progress, seniors should become peers rather than instructors.

## Karate Practice Must Be Beneficial

Karate training must provide some benefit to those that practice it. One obvious benefit is physical conditioning.
It should also promote a better understanding of the body. It should improve one's ability to defend themselves, should
the need arise.

### Corollary: Karate can not be focused purely on self-defense, sport, or physical education

Too much specialization in training, by nature, ultimately results in training that detracts from other possible
endeavors. Optimal self-defense training must incorporate topics that are well outside the scope of karate training.

Optimizing for practical application will lead to degraded ability to engage in karate for sport. Likewise, it
reduces the time available for focus on physical education. Additionally, the reality is that it is training for a
scenario the overwhelming statistical majority will never encounter.

Optimizing for sport naturally leads to degredation of the ability to defend one's self because habituation of
conforming to a rule set is needed. Additionally, too much emphasis on sport gates those who are not interested in
competition and those who's raw physical ability is compromised: the elderly and disabled.

Optimizing for pure physical education can lose sight of being able to apply that knowledge, for example, in a self-
defense or sport scenario. Some attempt at putting physical education to practical use must be made, or else karate
devolves into nothing more than calithenics.
