# Shotokan Kata Curriculum

## Beginner Mudansha

The Taikyoku kata were devised by Funakoshi Yoshitaka to familiarize what a kata is to students without prior
experience of the concept. Shotokan's Heian Nidan was the original first kata (then called Pinan Shodan) in the series
as taught by Itosu, Funakoshi Gichin's primary instructor. Funakoshi Gichin decided to swap the order of the first
two Heian kata, feeling that the sequence of the previously second kata would be easier for new students to learn.

* Taikyoku Shodan
* Taikyoku Nidan
* Heian Shodan
* Heian Nidan

## Intermediate Mudansha

Tekki Shodan is included in this list because it was the foundational kata that Itosu's students learned before he had
developed his Heian (Pinan) kata.

* Heian Sandan
* Heian Yondan
* Heian Godan
* Tekki Shodan

## Advanced Mudansha

In modern times, these four kata are considered to be the most fundamental to the Shotokan style.

* Bassai dai
* Empi
* Jion
* Kanku dai

## Dansha

These are the auxiliary versions of the basic and core kata. Bassai sho, Jiin, and Kanku sho were not originally part
of Funakoshi Gichin's original syllabus.

* Tekki Nidan, Tekki Sandan
* Bassai sho
* Jitte, Jiin
* Kanku sho

These are the other auxiliary kata from Funakoshi Gichin's original syllabus that he brought to Japan.

These kata were added later to the Shotokan syllabus.
